# Rank Calculator Challenge

This is a challenge from the DIO Bootcamp Potência Tech iFood - Programação do Zero. 

## Objective 

The challenge consists of creating a function that takes as parameters the wins and losses of a player, after that you're supposed to store the result in a variable. The score should be calculated by subtracting the amount of losses from the amount of wins.

```
- If victories are less than 10 = Iron
- If victories are between 11 and 20 = Bronze
- If victories are between 21 and 50 = Silver
- If victories are between 51 and 80 = Gold
- If victories are between 81 and 90 = Diamond
- If victories are between 91 and 100 = Legendary
- If victories are greater or equal to 101 = Immortal
```
At the end, the following message should be displayed: `The hero has a score of **{heroScore}** and is at the level **{heroLevel}**`.
